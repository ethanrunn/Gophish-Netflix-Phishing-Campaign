# üõ°Ô∏è Gophish-Netflix-Phishing-Campaign

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to plan, execute, and report a phishing simulation campaign using industry tools such as **GoPhish**, **ZohoMail**, and a local development stack (**Laragon**). It simulates a real-world phishing attack targeting user login behavior on a fake Netflix login page. This was done in a safe and ethical environment, strictly for educational and awareness purposes.

## Objective
To simulate a phishing attack targeting users with a fake Netflix login page to test phishing awareness and credential harvesting exposure among team organization staff.
- Develop a phishing campaign using GoPhish.
- Clone a realistic Netflix login page to serve as the bait.
- Log user credentials upon interaction.
- Redirect users to a success/awareness page.
- Create a detailed campaign report for analysis and portfolio purposes.

## üîñ Campaign Summary
- Campaign Name: Netflix Security Alert
- Platform Used: Gophish
- Date of Campaign Launch: 04/08/2025
- Duration: Results monitored over 3 days
- Fake landing page hosted locally/on the network: Using Laragon and VSCode

### üß™ Project Steps/Methodology

1. **Environment Setup**
   - Installed and configured **GoPhish** on Windows.
   - Set up a **local server** using Laragon to host phishing pages.

2. **Landing Page Creation**
   - Created a **fake Netflix login page** (`netflix-login.html`).
   - Wrote a PHP script (`capture.php`) to log user input into `log.txt`.
   - Redirected users to a custom **phish-success** page (`phish-success.html`).

3. **SMTP & Email Template**
   - Configured SMTP settings using Zoho Mail (with app-specific password due to 2FA).
   - Created a **realistic phishing email** with the sender name ‚ÄúNetflix Support.‚Äù
   - Embedded a call-to-action button directing to the fake login page.

4. **Campaign Setup**
   - Created target groups in GoPhish.
   - Tested email deliverability.
   - Launched the campaign with a scheduled trigger.

5. **Logging & Monitoring**
   - Verified that credentials were logged in `log.txt` after test submissions.
   - Monitored HTTP traffic and validated functionality via Wireshark.

6. **Report & Documentation**
   - Created a detailed PDF report and LinkedIn-style carousel.
   - Shared insights and takeaways via a LinkedIn post for visibility.

## Artifacts

## üìß Email Template Details
- Subject Line: Your Netflix Account Requires Verification
- Sender Name: Netflix Security Team
- Sender Email: support@netflix.com (spoofed)
- Email Content Summary: This is a security alert notifying the user of a suspicious login attempt and urging them to verify their account to avoid suspension. The email contains a call-to-action link redirecting to the phishing landing page.

## üåê Landing Page Details
- Landing Page Title: Netflix Login Page
- URL: http://localhost/netflix-phish-pages/netflix-login.html
- Website's behavior:
    - Shows the user a fake Netflix login page.
    - If the user attempts to log in, capture.php captures the user's login credentials
    - Capture.php saves credentials to log.txt
    - The user gets redirected to a friendly awareness page (phish-success.html) which informs the user that they've fallen for a test phishing simulation.

    - Image 3.4 - Log.txt file showing captured user's credentials

## üë• Target Group(s)
- User Group Name: "Test Users"
- Number of Recipients: 3
- Delivery Method: SMTP via Zoho Mail
- Picture: Image 4.1 - Zoho Mail Admin Dashboard showing admin profile and test users

## üìä Results & Metrics
- Emails Sent: 3
- Emails Opened: 3
- Emails reported as Spam: 2
- Link Clicks: 2
- Credentials Submitted: 1
- Unique Users Phished: 1 (33%)
- Bounce/Failed Deliveries - Hehehe funny story. I didn't set **MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC** records for my mail service provider when I first launched the campaign, so all the emails got dropped i.e. they didn't make it into the inbox of the targets. I did some troubleshooting and research before I realized that was the issue and then fixed it and relaunched the campaign, this time, there were no bounces or failed deliveries
- Security Awareness Insight: At a **33%** success rate, this campaign showed that **1 in 3** users in my test organization fell for the phishing scam. This sets a bad precedent for this fictional organization as threat actors only need **ONE WEAK LINK**.

## ‚úÖ Lessons Learned / Recommendations
- Educate users on verifying sender addresses and spotting red flags in suspicious emails.
- Encourage use of multi-factor authentication (MFA) to reduce impact even if credentials are phished.
- Simulate regular phishing tests to improve awareness and build a security-conscious culture.
- Implement secure email gateways with phishing protection rules.
